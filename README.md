# OrbitSI: An Orbit-based Algorithm for the Subgraph Isomorphism Search Problem

OrbitSI is a novel algorithm designed to address the Subgraph Isomorphism (SI) problem. By leveraging orbit counts of graphlets, OrbitSI improves the filtering and ordering phases, which are critical in SI search algorithms. This repository contains the implementation of the OrbitSI algorithm, along with datasets and scripts for reproducing the experimental results.
